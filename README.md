## Introduction

Documentation of the MR analysis to prioritize risk factors for severe COVID-19 using TwoSampleMR by Yitang Sun and Kaixiong Ye.

Any of the most recent COVID-19 GWAS can be used in the code to apply exhaustive MR analyses.

## Download

Download_COVID_19.sh

Only need to change link pathway to update more recent COVID-19 GWAS.

## Combine SNP

Combine_outcome_SNP.r

Only need to change the pathway.

## Mendelian Randomization Study

MR_forward.r

Only need to change the pathway.

## Introduction

This directory contains supplementary code for our Mendelian randomization analysis to prioritize risk factors for severe COVID-19 using the TwoSampleMR R package by Yitang Sun and Kaixiong Ye.

Any of the most recent COVID-19 GWAS can be used in the code to apply exhaustive MR analyses.

## Download

Download_COVID_19.sh

You only need to change the link pathway to update the more recent COVID-19 GWAS.

## Combine SNP

Combine_outcome_SNP.r

You only need to change the pathway.

## Mendelian randomization study

MR_forward.r

You only need to change the pathway.
